Why?
=========

Imagine you have just discovered that you are diabetic and you would need to carefully manage your blood glucose for the rest of your life. This requires a strict discipline of watching what you eat, maintaining the regular physical activity level, being aware of your blood glucose levels and keeping a close eye on it. Over the long period of time these tasks become tiring and motivation to continue that discipline starts fading away which can cause serious long term health damages. 

What?
==========

As humans we always do better when we have support and we work with others. With GlucoApp you can not only record and monitor your own blood glucose, food intake, medication but also can share that information with the other people who are suffering from the same condition. You can share tips and information that is working for you and follow others who have proven to manage their own diabetes well over a long period of time. The idea of this app is to let the community support and motivate each other to live healthy with this condition. The app would also try to keep the users motivated by rewarding good habbits and will improve your ranking to have more influence in the community.
